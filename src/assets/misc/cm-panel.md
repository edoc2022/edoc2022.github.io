Marco Wobben (CEO of CaseTalk; casetalk.com)

Bio: Hi, my name is Marco Wobben. I started my career as an independent software developer in the early nineties. As an entrepreneur I continued development of the FCO-IM casetool in 2001 under the name of CaseTalk. As owner of the company, consultant, developer, trainer and presenter, I'm considered the driving force behind CaseTalk and I'm enjoying every bit of it.

With contributions from researchers, teachers, professors, students, developers, consultants, customers, and enthusiasts, we made CaseTalk what it is today. I thank them to help me make CaseTalk the preferred choice of fact oriented information modeling tool to many.

Enrico Franconi (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; unibz.it)

Bio: The research area I am working on is related to the application of database, artificial intelligence, and semantic technologies to concrete problems in information systems design and maintenance, in data integration, intelligent access, analysis and restructuring of big data. This subject area is quite vast, and involves both theoretical and applicative skills: the appropriate balance between these two aspects can provide a unique added value to the research area. My goal is to let practitioners to apply foundational results, and push theoreticians to understand the complex nature of the real issues. This can be achieved together with a research group which has a critical mass to include a variety of perspectives in the entire range from theory to practice. The interdisciplinary aspects of this research area are also crucial: together with the theory vs practice aspect, these are system aspects, methodological aspects, interaction and communication aspects, usability aspects, complexity aspects, correctness aspects, efficiency aspects, deployability aspects.

The KRDB Research Centre for Knowledge and Data at the Faculty of Computer Science of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano was founded by me in 2002, and it aims at being an international centre of excellence in basic and applied research on KRDB technologies and at proposing to selected enterprises innovative ideas and technologies based on the research developed in the centre.
