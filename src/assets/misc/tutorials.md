## Title: Business Process Modeling and Simulation with DPMN

- **Abstract**:

The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) has been successfully established as the defacto standard in Business Process (BP) Management. However, BPMN does not have a convincing formal semantics and lacks several important elements needed for BP simulation. BPMN is also not well-aligned with the Processing/Queuing Network paradigm of Operations Research (OR) and the related business process simulation paradigm pioneered by the Discrete Event Simulation (DES) languages/tools GPSS and SIMAN/Arena. The Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation (DPMN) is based on the Object Event Modeling and Simulation (OEM&S) paradigm and on Event Graphs (Schruben 1983), which capture the event scheduling paradigm of DES. DPMN supports modeling resource-constrained activities (with resource roles and resource pools) in Activity Networks and  Processing Networks, as well as basic agent concepts (perception, action, communication) and agent-based BP modeling.

- **Short Bio**:

Gerd Wagner is Professor of Internet Technology at Brandenburg University of Technology, Cottbus, Germany. After studying Mathematics, Philosophy and Informatics in Heidelberg, San Francisco and Berlin, he (1) investigated the semantics of negation in knowledge representation formalisms, (2) developed concepts and techniques for agent-oriented modeling and simulation, (3) participated in the development of a foundational ontology for conceptual modeling, the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), and (4) created a new Discrete Event Simulation paradigm: Object Event Modeling and Simulation (OEM&S), and a new process modeling language: the Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation (DPMN). He also maintains the website [web-engineering.info](http://web-engineering.info/) and the web-based simulation portal [sim4edu.com](http://sim4edu.com/).
