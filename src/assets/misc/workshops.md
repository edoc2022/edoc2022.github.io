- **Title**: Business Process Modeling and Simulation with DPMN

- **Abstract**: The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) has been successfully established as the defacto standard in Business Process (BP) Management. However, BPMN does not have a convincing formal semantics and lacks several important elements needed for BP simulation. BPMN is also not well-aligned with the Processing/Queuing Network paradigm of Operations Research (OR) and the related business process simulation paradigm pioneered by the Discrete Event Simulation (DES) languages/tools GPSS and SIMAN/Arena. The Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation (DPMN) is based on the Object Event Modeling and Simulation (OEM&S) paradigm and on Event Graphs (Schruben 1983), which capture the event scheduling paradigm of DES. DPMN supports modeling resource-constrained activities (with resource roles and resource pools) in Activity Networks and  Processing Networks, as well as basic agent concepts (perception, action, communication) and agent-based BP modeling.

- **Short Bio**: Gerd Wagner is Professor of Internet Technology at Brandenburg University of Technology, Cottbus, Germany. After studying Mathematics, Philosophy and Informatics in Heidelberg, San Francisco and Berlin, he (1) investigated the semantics of negation in knowledge representation formalisms, (2) developed concepts and techniques for agent-oriented modeling and simulation, (3) participated in the development of a foundational ontology for conceptual modeling, the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), and (4) created a new Discrete Event Simulation paradigm: Object Event Modeling and Simulation (OEM&S), and a new process modeling language: the Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation (DPMN). He also maintains the website [web-engineering.info](http://web-engineering.info/) and the web-based simulation portal [sim4edu.com](http://sim4edu.com/).

- **Description**: The EDOC Workshop – Intelligent Digital Architecture, Methods, and Services for Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 – covers fundamental and practical aspects to support digital transformation. This disruptive change interacts with all information processes and systems, which are important business enablers for the digital transformation for years. Intelligent digital architectures enable intense interaction with customers and products. The customer is closely integrated with business processes and interacts like a co-worker by using implicit touchpoints, which are provided by mobility and wearable systems and the Internet of Things. In this way, customer experience is fostered with disruptive transformation and continuous improvement.

### TEAR

- **Title**: Trends in Enterprise Architecture Research
- **Chairs**:
- **Important Dates**:
- **Links**:

- Call for Papers: [https://tear-series.org/](https://tear-series.org/)
- Submission Website: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tear2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tear2022)

- **Description**:The international TEAR workshop series brings together Enterprise Architecture (EA) researchers from different research communities and provides a forum to present EA research results and to discuss future EA research directions. EA covers the entire “business-to-IT stack” of an enterprise by explicitly incorporating business-related artifacts in addition to conventional IS/IT artifacts. This is in contrast to conventional architecture management approaches such as IT architecture, software architecture, or IS architecture, which often focus on one (IT centric) aspect only. We invite submissions on original EA research results, i.e., submissions that have not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. Selected best papers of TEAR 2022 will be invited to a special issue of the well established Software and Systems Modeling journal.

  - Submission Website [TBA](TBA)

- **Description**: Enterprise Engineering (EE) is the application of engineering principles to the design of Enterprise Architectures. It enables deriving the Enterprise Architecture from the enterprise goals and strategy and aligning it with the enterprise resources. Enterprise architecture is used to map the enterprise goal and strategy to the enterprise’s resources (actors, assets, IT supports) and to support the evolution of this mapping. It also provides documentation on the assignment of enterprise resources to the enterprise goals and strategy. There are different paradigms for creating enterprise architecture. The most important is to encapsulate the functionalities of IT resources as services. By this means, it is possible to clearly describe the contributions of IT both in terms of functionality and quality and to define a service-oriented enterprise architecture (SoEA).

### FLPM

Awaiting info Andrea.

- **Title**: 1st International Workshop on Forward-Looking Process Mining
- **Chairs**:
- **Important Dates**:
- **Links**:

  - Call for Papers [https://flpm-workshop.github.io/](https://flpm-workshop.github.io/)
  - Submission Website [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flpm2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flpm2022)

- **Description**: Forward-looking techniques in process mining enable organizations to create their own digital twins. Process mining provides data-driven support for businesses to make their processes transparent. Most process mining techniques are backward-looking. They generate descriptive process models based on historical data and identify performance and compliance issues. Forward-looking process mining focuses on turning the results of backward-looking techniques into actions. Process mining is capable of providing insights into the future of processes given the provided insight, i.e., the currently discovered insights. The purpose of this workshop is to present and discuss the potential forward-looking process mining techniques where they play a role in an organization's digital twin. The scope of the workshop includes approaches such as data-driven process model generation, simulation, and prediction, as well as a human role in these approaches.
