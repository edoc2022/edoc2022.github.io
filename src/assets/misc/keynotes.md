- **Title**: "We Are All Digital Now": Platform Systems and Flow Processes in Modern Enterprises
- **Abstract**:

In the last 25 years, modern enterprises have become centered on digital systems. IT applications, knit together by enterprise architectures, now pervade all business functions. But there is still doubt and confusion as to how a firm’s digital infrastructure should be managed and maintained. On the one hand, modern enterprises must be flexible, capable of generating a stream of new products and providing customers with numerous options. On the other hand, they must be efficient providing timely solutions at low cost.

These contrasting requirements are exemplified by two opposing technical paradigms: flow processes and platform systems. In the talk, I will characterize flow processes and platform systems in terms of their innate properties and organizational implications. I will also indicate when and why each patterns is more valuable. In modern establishments, the two patterns are not mutually exclusive: technologically sophisticated organizations must use both. At the end of the talk, I will speculate on where each pattern is likely to be needed and invite comments on the tensions they are likely to cause within organizations.

- **Title**: Smart modeling of smart software
- **Abstract**:

There is an increasing demand for embedding intelligence in software systems as part of its core set of features both in the front-end (e.g. conversational user interfaces) and back-end (e.g. prediction services). This combination is usually referred to as AI-enhanced software or, simply, smart software.

The development of smart software poses new engineering challenges,  as now we need to deal with the engineering of the “traditional” components, the engineering of the “AI” ones but also of the interaction between both types that need to co-exist and collaborate.

In this talk we’ll see how modeling can help tame the complexity of engineering smart software by enabling software engineers specify and generate smart software systems starting from higher-level and platform-independent modeling primitives.  

But, unavoidably, these models will be more diverse and complex than our usual ones. Don’t despair, we’ll also see how some of these same AI techniques that are making our modeling life challenging can be turned into allies and be transformed into modeling assistants to tackle the engineering of smart software with a new breed of smart modeling tools.

- **Title**: Trustworthiness in Industrial IoT Systems: trends and issues for the future Collaborative and Computing Enterprise
- **Abstract**:

Trustworthiness, the combination of security, privacy, resilience, reliability and safety, is especially critical in industrial systems. Life, limb and the environment are at risk.

Unfortunately, these trustworthiness characteristics often conflict. Security would suggest locking that door, but safety demands it be able to be opened in case of emergency. This is resolvable, but often further factors must then be considered. (A bad actor could open the door from the inside. Now what?)

The Industry IoT Consortium has published the Trustworthiness Foundation, which outlines eleven principles to help guide you through the maze. This presentation will show how these principles can help you build a trustworthy system.
